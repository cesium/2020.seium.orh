I have helped organize multiple editions of our Software Engineering Week (SEI), a five-day event with dozens of talks and a 48 hours hackathon over the weekend. I co-hosted one season of CeSIUM’s Podcast called “Periférico” which is available on most platforms.\nI co-organize the 2020 edition of ENEI, which happened at the Altice Forum Braga with 600 attendees and more than 30 companies. This national conference aims to bring together informatics, computer science and engineering students to learn, socialize and connect with each other and the business world.\nWhile I was an active member of CeSIUM, I have co-lead the CoderDojo at Braga since 2018, an open, non-profit, free movement which aims to teach programming to children and teenagers from 7 to 17.\nBack in 2017, I joined #include <braga>, a volunteering movement that directly impacted the local community through tech. While I was there, I helped organize two editions of Secret Santa, which involved more than 160 children, young and old in disadvantaged social conditions.\nIf you want to chat say hi at @nelsonmestevao or write me an email at nelson@estevao.org."
