        "description": "The beginning of the 20's allows to focus simultaneously on the “hardware” and the “software” of computing. The interaction between technologies suggests the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to attack some complex problems (creative, divergent) with large amounts of data. However, we are still far from mastering human intelligence (concepts, abstraction, analogy) and the conservation of privacy raises questions of ethics.",

        "description": "The end of password-based authentication is near. Weak passwords are the cause of endless security breaches, and the constant reuse of the same password across different accounts is what keeps the clock ticking for the next breach to happen. The FIDO2 standard aims to replace passwords entirely, and there is a good deal of chance that it will succeed. It has gained significant momentum in the past couple of years, as all major browser and operating system vendors fully jumped on board. This talk will provide a deep dive of the FIDO2 and W3C WebAuthn standards, with the main focus on how to quickly implement it on any JVM/GraalVM based application using open-source FIDO Alliance conformant libraries. Best practices, including security token lifecycle management, will also be covered. Attendees should have basic knowledge in password usage and be able to identify the major problems with this system. Furthermore, attendees should be capable of bootstrapping a web application project and have basic knowledge on request routing and the basic principles of web security.",

        "description": "Elixir is a functional programming language, highly scalable and open-source created by José Valim backed by the community. Elixir was created because of the lack of capability of some languages like ruby to adopt concurrency models, this made José Valim search for solutions. That’s when he found Functional Programming and Erlang. Functional programming, due to the immutability, solved a lot of concurrency problems that other languages had and, Erlang’s Virtual Machine (BEAM) was ahead of everyone in terms of distribution. The community was sold on this premiss and soon projects started being released to support the Elixir environment. One of the biggest projects is Phoenix, an open-source framework that allows devs to build web apps using Elixir. One famous feature is LiveView, which allows the combination of server-side rendering and real-time features without the JS complexity. In this talk, we will dive into the basis for the creation of Erlang and how they fit into modern world requirements to build large scale applications and how the Elixir community is expanding its horizons into spaces like Data Science, Machine Learning and many others.",

These affect not software we create or control, but things we buy, rent or re-use and eventually bundle as part of our stack. From known exploits such as Sunburn to potentially catastrophic ones like Hearthbleed and Log4Shell, these are now part of the zeitgeist and became one of the most sought-after topics for the security community, culminating in a brand new critical category that jumped straight into the top 10 of the latest OWASP report. With the pervasiveness of Open Source and the increasing popularity of easy-to-use package managers and repositories like NPM, the risks have only been exacerbated and the topic became a big concern for everyone, from indie developers to huge Fortune 500 companies. In this talk, we will dive into the history and scope of software supply chain vulnerabilitie and attacks whilst discussing how to mitigate the risks they pose to developers, enterprises and users alike.",
